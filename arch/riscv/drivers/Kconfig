config CONFIG_STRING
	bool "Platform device config-string parser"
	depends on RISCV
	default y
	help
	   This enables support for reading and parsing the configuration
	   string typically found on RISC-V systems. The string describes
	   devices included in the on-board SoC. Without this option, any
	   devices described in the config string will not be loaded.

	   Say 'Y' here if you have a standard RISC-V platform.

config PLIC
	bool "Platform-Level Interrupt Controller"
	depends on CONFIG_STRING
	default y
	help
	   This enables support for the PLIC chip found in standard RISC-V
	   systems. The PLIC is the top-most interrupt controller found in
	   the system, connected directly to the core complex. All other
	   interrupt sources (MSI, GPIO, etc) are subordinate to the PLIC.

	   If you don't know what to do here, say Y.

config RISCV_UART
    bool "RISC-V UART controller"
    depends on CONFIG_STRING
    default y
    help
       This enables support for the UART chip found in standard RISC-V
       systems.

       If you don't know what to do here, say Y.
